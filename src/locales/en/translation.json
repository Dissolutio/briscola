  "Help_text_4": "The game of <i>Instant Briscola</i> begins as soon as two players are in the lobby. The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt three cards. The seventh card from the deck is the <i>briscola</i> - It represents the trump suit for the game and it's placed face up on the board. The remainder of the deck is placed face down next to the <i>briscola</i> card and players will draw cards from it throughout the game.",
  "Help_text_5": "In the <i>Instant Briscola</i> the player who created the lobby leads the first trick by playing one of his cards face up on the board. The opponent then responds with a card of his own and the played cards are compared at this point.",
  "Help_text_6": "The winner of the trick is determined as follows:<br />- If only one player played a <i>briscola</i>, he wins no matter what card the opponent played<br />- If both players played a card of the same suit ( <i>briscola</i> or any other suit), the winner is determined by comparing the strength of the played cards<br />- If neither player played a <i>briscola</i> card and the played cards are not of the same suit, the player who was the first to play in the trick wins it",

  "Help_text_8": "The winner of the trick pockets both played cards and is dealt a new card from the top of the shuffled deck. The loser of the trick receives the next card from the deck and we enter the next trick where the winner of the last trick plays the first card. The play proceeds in this manner until the deck is empty. Note that the last card collected in the game should be the up-turned <i>briscola</i>. The fact that the <i>briscola</i> is now in the hand of one of the players does not change anything about the trump suit of the game and we proceed with playing until all forty cards are collected from the board. It is time to calculate the total point value of cards each player acquired and determine the winner. Since there is a total of 120 points in the full Briscola deck, the player who collected at least 61 points wins the game.",
